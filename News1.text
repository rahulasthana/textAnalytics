the amendments to the prevention of corruption act  adopted recently by both houses of parliament are a mixed bag moves to make changes in this law aimed at combating corruption in government were initiated during the upas second term in office and largely centred on the misuse of one provision  section  d former prime minister manmohan singh had criticised this section under which public servants are culpable for securing a pecuniary advantage for another without any public interest for ignoring a foundational principle of criminal law mens rea this resulted in many honest officials being prosecuted even when they gained nothing and merely exercised their power or discretion in favour of someone insofar as it had a chilling effect on governance and deterred bold decisionmaking the amended form may have a liberating effect on honest officials besides it is more concise and restricts criminal misconduct to two offences misappropriating or converting to ones own use property entrusted to a public servant or is in his control and amassing unexplained wealth there was concern initially with the wording intentionally enriches himself illicitly during the period of his office as it raised a doubt whether the intention to amass wealth would also have to be proved now an explanation has been added that a person shall be presumed to have intentionally enriched himself if he cannot account for his assets through known sources of income

by making citizens liable for offering a bribe to a public servant the anticorruption law has been brought in line with the un convention against corruption the only exception to this rule is when one is forced to give a bribe this exception kicks in only when the fact that one was forced to pay a bribe is reported to a law enforcement authority within seven days the penal provision can empower people by allowing them to cite it to refuse to pay a bribe at the same time what happens when the police or any other agency refuses to register a complaint people may be left in the lurch with no redress further it may render them vulnerable to threats from unscrupulous public servants who collect money to speed up public services but do not deliver the most unacceptable change is the introduction of a prior approval norm to start an investigation when a prior sanction requirement exists in law for prosecution it is incomprehensible that the legislature should create another layer of protection in the initial stage of a probe public servants need to be protected against unfair prosecution but a genuine drive against corruption needs a package of legislative measures these should contain penal provisions create an ombudsman in the form of a lokpal or lokayukta as well as assure citizens of timebound services and whistleblower protection laws to fulfil these objectives are either not operational or are yet to materialise
